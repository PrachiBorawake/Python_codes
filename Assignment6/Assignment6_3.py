#Write a program which contains one class named as Numbers.Arithmetic class contains one instance variables as Value.
#Inside init method initialise that instance variables to the value which is accepted from user.
#There are four instance methods inside class as ChkPrime(), ChkPerfect(), SumFactors(),
#Factors().ChkPrime() method will returns true if number is prime otherwise return false.
#ChkPerfect() method will returns true if number is perfect otherwise return false.
#Factors() method will display all factors of instance variable.
#SumFactors() method will return addition of all factors. Use this method in any another method as a helper method if required.
#After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multiple objects.
